Certainly! Here's an explanation of each line of code and the purpose of the modules used:

1. **Line 2:** The `Flask` class from the `flask` module is imported. It is used to create the Flask application.

2. **Line 3:** The `Celery` class from the `celery` module is imported. Celery is a distributed task queue system that allows you to run tasks asynchronously. It is used to schedule and run background jobs.

3. **Line 5-6:** The Flask application is created, and the configuration for Celery is set. The `CELERY_BROKER_URL` and `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` specify the broker URL and result backend URL, respectively. In this example, Redis is used as the broker and result backend.

4. **Line 7:** An instance of the Celery application is created, using the Flask application's name and configuration.

5. **Line 8:** The Celery configuration is updated with the Flask application's configuration.

6. **Line 13-15:** The `@app.route` decorator is used to define a Flask route at the `/update_rides` URL path. It handles POST requests and triggers the `update_rides` function when accessed.

7. **Line 17-20:** The `daily_update_rides` function is defined as a Celery task. It runs the Flask endpoint `update_rides` by making a test POST request within the Flask application context.

8. **Line 22-26:** The `setup_periodic_tasks` function is connected to the `celery.on_after_configure` signal. It schedules the `daily_update_rides` task to run daily at 12:00 AM using the `add_periodic_task` method.

9. **Line 29-31:** The `daily_update_rides` function is scheduled to run daily at 12:00 AM using the `BackgroundScheduler` from APScheduler. The `CronTrigger` is set to trigger at the specified time.
10. **Line 33:** The `scheduler.start()` method is called to start the APScheduler.

The overall flow of the code is as follows:

- The Flask application is created with the necessary configuration for Celery.

- The `/update_rides` route is defined to handle POST requests and trigger the `update_rides` function.

- The `daily_update_rides` task is created as a Celery task or APScheduler job.

- The `setup_periodic_tasks` function (for Celery) or the `scheduler.add_job` method (for APScheduler) is used to schedule the daily task.

- The Flask application is run, and the scheduled task automatically triggers the `update_rides` function at the specified time each day.

This setup ensures that the rides table is automatically updated with the vehicles for each day based on the scheduled task.'''
